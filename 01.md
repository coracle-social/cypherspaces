# Abstract

Memory: Thucydides and the shallows

The ancients understood the centrality of human memory in cultivating wisdom. The purpose of knowledge, for them, was to change both the individual and society to move them closer to virtue. They knew the danger of externalizing memory, but technology moved forward anyway. And now we find ourselves in the "shallows", where the digital logic takes over, and memory fails.
