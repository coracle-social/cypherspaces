# Abstract

Memory: Thucydides and the shallows

Socrates, a contemporary of Thucydides, worried that writing would erode our ability to remember. As time has gone on, our memories have been externalized in the form of written books, print, and finally digital media. We live in what Nicholas Carr calls "The Shallows", a liminal space somewhere between reality and abstraction, where history repeats itself because we fail to study the past, and where we lose even our own identities, even as we strive to express them in ever more frantic rituals of self-making. But if we can refocus our attention on our native spaces and times, even within the abstractions of the digital world, we can rediscover our pace and find ourselves again.

# Outline

## The ancient regard for memory (HF 128)

- Thucydides recounting Pericles' funeral oration
- Socrates' worry that writing would erode our ability to remember
- Anecdote about Augustine reading silently
- Aristotle: "experience is formed of many memories" (HF 131)
- The physical is what contains our memory (HF 188)

## The promise of technology

- How tools work: extend, eliminate, retrieve, reverse (GTC 104, HF 73)
- "Print provided a vast new memory for past writings that made personal memory inadequate" (McLuhan 174)
- Sparkism: worship of knowledge (HF 88)

## Democratization

- The logic of digital media is to accelerate, compress, and simplify (McLuhan)
- Digital media came out of a pluralistic, democratic society, and was unreflectively adopted because it reflected our values.
- Democratization fallacy, "A more perfect liquefaction" (Carr 12-14, 130, 131, 145)
- "But a medium of perfect anonymity has no more to offer, politically speaking, than a medium of perfect transparency: both crypto anarchists and communists with Chinese charactersitics share the aim of eliminating the need for public life. Both therefore share the same altogether negative notion of freedom." This is the freedom to an undisturbed private life, which is the freedom not to be responsible because policy consists in technical challenges that are better managed by able administrators. (Barba-Kay 146)
- The Swarm (HF) and "Authenticity" (HF 51) - individualism leads to the mass
- "Scaling" communities, "frictionless sharing", technocracy (Carr 17). Society does not scale (Carr 18, 164)
- "Digital globalism" (HF 205)
- Leads to centralization (McLuhan, 95, 100)

## Losing ourselves

- Anecdote in Understanding Media about the chinese guy (McLuhan 63)
- Studies about data entry, hyperlinks (Shallows)
- Tech moves our memory outside us (McLuhan)
- "The internet is therefore a new kind of collective memory, selecting for what is disposable and preserving it indefinitely - it is a machine for producing what is forgettable by rendering it unforgettable." (Barba-Kay, 36)
- "Our tools formally shape us in a way unlike and incomparable to the instrumental way we shape them" (HF 140)

## Making a new self (HF 51)

- The rule of imagination over memory (HF 177)
- Queer design (HF 180-181)
- Quantification/instrumetalization (HF 55, 58)
- The queering of the self is to make the self explicit (HF 176, 178)
- "The data-driven character of the medium is such as to translate larger human questions about how to live into technical puzzles that may be... 'hacked'." (Barba-Kay, 42)
- "Techno-gnosticism" (HF 158)

## The political approach: family, church, politics, culture

- CHT https://vimeo.com/761665339 @11:00 - feedback loop between technology, culture, and institutions/markets
- CHT Framework of Interventions https://www.humanetech.com/solutions
- Aristotle on politics (HF)
- The problem comes from technology, that should be our starting point even though people are rightly discouraged about it
- The political system is corrupt, and is actively working against the interests of the people
- We need to take responsibility for ourselves - this act alone is salutary
- This book focuses on technology
