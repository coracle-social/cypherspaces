# Techno-skeptics

People who have deleted their facebook or "only use it for marketplace". Who are potentially into privacy tech and self-hosting, or if not, at least align against Big Tech and Big Media and Big AI, and who don't like the idea of being spied on, even if they don't do much about it. People whose primary use case for social media is to stay connected with friends and family, or to read the news.

# Techno-optimists

People who are excited about freedom tech - i.e. bitcoin & nostr, but who need a reality check about the limits of technology to govern, and the inability of technology to self-regulate. Technology has to be steered intentionally. If we want more of what is great about bitcoin, we need to engineer it. I should be channeling Bitcoin Mechanic when talking to these people. People who may be less familiar with Christian Ontology.
