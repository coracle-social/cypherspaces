# Abstract

Identity: Privacy, secrecy and anonymity

Our lives were never meant to be put on display before the world. When we broadcast our inner thoughts to whatever audience we can attract, only the most interesting - and therefore, humiliating - parts are remembered. Holding back our thoughts is an essential part of wisdom. Secrecy, on the other hand, implies that some action is purposely hidden from those who have a right to know. Anonymity may be used in service of either end - but it cannot be abolished without destroying the ability of the individual to remain a private and distinct person.
