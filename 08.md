# Abstract

Time Preference: Wendell Berry and humane design

Wendell Berry is best known for lamenting the loss of family farms as a result of the proliferation of industrial technology in farming. He sees the beauty of an integrated life, and the place of work in it. He sees the erosion of the soil as the loss of a legacy that will be felt for many generations after him. Protecting this heritage requires putting up fences, culturally, politically, and technologically. Speed increases connections, but it also increases fragility. Building on an open protocol makes it possible to experiment in low-risk ways, while at the same time enabling users to choose the products that reflect their values.

- "Perfect usefulness is to capture our attention by allowing us to act on it... Attention is not neutral. It is the act by which we confer meaning on things and by which we discover that they are meaningful." (Barba-Kay, 63, lots more there, more on _64_)
