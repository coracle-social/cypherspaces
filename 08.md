# Abstract

Time Preference: Wendell Berry and humane design

Wendell Berry is best known for lamenting the loss of family farms as a result of the proliferation of industrial technology in farming. He sees the beauty of an integrated life, and the place of work in it. He sees the erosion of the soil as the loss of a legacy that will be felt for many generations after him. Protecting this heritage requires putting up fences, culturally, politically, and technologically. Building on an open protocol makes it possible to experiment in low-risk ways, while at the same time enabling users to choose the products that reflect their values.

# Outline

- Wendell Berry
  - Erosion, strip mining, industrial farming
  - Family farming, dignity of animals (Salatin), local food
  - The Soil as an inheritance
- Fences
  - Examples of what they're for in agriculture
  - Fences do not confine the person who puts them up - they are an instrument of freedom.
  - Chesterton's fence
  - First, we must Remember the fences that have been removed, then we may add new ones
  - What can people do that bots can't? Barba-Kay points at the act of saying "no". (BK 247)
- We live in an age of tearing down, not building up. What has been torn down?
  - Broken paradigm of today's extractive tech: https://vimeo.com/761665339 @40:00
  - Public vs private
  - Individual vs mass
  - Local vs global
- What fences might we erect? Not to confine us, but to make us free.
  - 12 leverage points for changing a system: https://www.humanetech.com/insights/a-framework-for-changing-complex-systems
  - Humane technologists are ethical agents of systemic change https://vimeo.com/761665339 @50:00
  - Frictional design (Superbloom 225)
- Permaculture - Scott Mann
  - Localism and an open system makes it possible to erect local fences.
  - Experimentation is part of permaculture
- Media ecology - McLuhan
- Skill
  - We should do things that ask something of us. Everything else is flattery - a simulation of achievement, not achievement itself. Wood carving vs 3D printing; strategy games vs role playing games.
  - "Perfect usefulness is to capture our attention by allowing us to act on it... Attention is not neutral. It is the act by which we confer meaning on things and by which we discover that they are meaningful." (Barba-Kay, 63, lots more there, more on _64_)
