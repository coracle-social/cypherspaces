The transcendent virtues need to be embodied in the digital world as well. Futurepaul's metaphor of marriage.

### Destruction of community

"All manner of new digital community platforms are, for all these reasons, not simply simulating offline communities, but helping dissolve them - and then selling the narcotic self-indulgence of 'belonging' back to their users." (wooom 103)

### What are people for

God's money - industrialism values profit, we have to value people. GDP vs wealth.
Transhumanism is the application of efficiency as the ultimate value to the human body.

### Policy

Collective action problem (Jonathan Haidt)

### Technical

Why technical vs policy?

- Incentives can't be fixed by fiat

User-centric internet

Introduce nostr

- Self-verifying data allows for decoupling of storage and trust.

# Design

Dark vs light patterns
Notifications - in-app vs push vs digest
Broadcast vs contextual
Encryption vs hosting, alignment of admins
Facts vs opinions - wikifreedia
The role of LLMs - content? search?
Web of trust - spam, recommendations
Translation of identifiable social clusters into communities through wot
Hypernotes - decoupling of content, form, aesthetic, access (security/privacy), functionality. cf futurepaul podcast

### Things to avoid

- Reactive, unpremeditated thought (chat, reply, no undo or delay)
- Measurement (interoperable analytics, public data, quantified/unambiguous responses like emojis/likes)
- Permanent records of ephemeral conversations (digital signatures, broadcast)
- Context-unaware communication (broadcast notes)

### Things to cultivate

- Tethers to reality (calendars)
- Local consensus, exported publicly


# Other stuff

- The foolishness of God
- Stewardship, dominion mandate
- The idea that everyone should put their money where their mouth is. Faithfulness in little
- "Our tools formally shape us in a way unlike and incomparable to the instrumental way we shape them" (HF 140)
- Make sure to mention that social media is not for kids! Keep kids off it. [Clare Morell]
- An open system can be flooded, the flipside to censorship is amplification
- Disambiguate cryptography, crypto, and bitcoin
