# Poem

the internet is a dog's breakfast
always on
silenced, scrutinized, leave a review
never off
abandoned, harried, simulated
authentic fakery
counterfeit living
attention absorbed, inner externalized, meaning mocked

what was is what I am
what I am is what will be
remember, in order to become
imagine, in order to act
memory stagnates
imagination wanders
inertia? or chaos
decline, decay, or
the queering of the self
or:
roots and leaves
Chesterton's fence, and new ones too

I am not alone
reality is witnessed
politics is for virtue
politics is for happiness
we build the city
and melt into its form
the rule of man
the rule of man
becoming the image
measured, weighed, wanting
the gathering of form exports chaos
inertia. nirvana. death.
just wait

spoken
nature groans
to be filled
with what?
God speaks: freedom
man answers
Man speaks: freedom
nature answers
created, redeemed
suspended, enveloped
transcendence: reality

the fire on the altar
the garden in the city
a crown on the forehead
work is prayer
a whole, burnt offering
unmade, remade, revealed

the internet
unmakes: a more perfect liquefaction
remakes: the digital native
reveals: the sovereign individual
politics, culture, community
yes, but
technology reformed
