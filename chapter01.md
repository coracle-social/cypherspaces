Memory: Thucydides and the shallows

Socrates, a contemporary of Thucydides, worried that writing would erode our ability to remember. As time has gone on, our memories have been externalized in the form of written books, print, and finally digital media. We live in what Nicholas Carr calls "The Shallows", a liminal space somewhere between reality and abstraction, where history repeats itself because we fail to study the past, and where we lose even our own identities, even as we strive to express them in ever more frantic rituals of self-making. But if we can refocus our attention on our native spaces and times, even within the abstractions of the digital world, we can rediscover our pace and find ourselves again.
