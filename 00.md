This book is for everyone, but it's also for no one. It's the book I've been wishing existed ever since I started working in the social media space, because it attempts to answer the question: can digital media be redeemed? This question is fundamentally a question about human flourishing because of what technology is - technology is a tool created by man for the purpose of self-making. At the same time, it is also a question about _technique_ - how can we shape our technologies in such a way that they shape us well?

For this reason, there will be parts of this book that bore or alienate my less theologically-inclined readers. But these parts are necessary, because in order to answer any question about human flourishing, we have to know in turn _what humans are for_.

There will also be parts of this book that bore or alientate my less technically-inclined readers because, well, this is a book about technology.

For this, I apologize in advance.

- I won't be talking much about policy, because that's not my area of expertise.
- I write this book for myself to answer a question I had:
- "How might digital technology be reformed to promote human flourishing?"
- This isn't about cryptocurrency, but about cryptography (although bitcoin may be used as an example of effective use of cryptography).
