# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Cryptography can be used to craft a more humane social media ecosystem by freeing information from custodians, decoupling digital identities from third-party providers, encouraging openness and innovation, embracing privacy and community, and anchoring the digital world in the real.

# Part 1: Liquefaction

## Memory: Thucydides and the shallows [link](./01.md)

Socrates, a contemporary of Thucydides, worried that writing would erode our ability to remember. As time has gone on, our memories have been externalized in the form of written books, print, and finally digital media. We live in what Nicholas Carr calls "The Shallows", a liminal space somewhere between reality and abstraction, where history repeats itself because we fail to study the past, and where we lose even our own identities, even as we strive to express them in ever more frantic rituals of self-making. But if we can refocus our attention on our native spaces and times, even within the abstractions of the digital world, we can rediscover our pace and find ourselves again.

# Part 2: Technology that says "no"

## Censorship: the custodians of knowledge [link](./02.md)

As knowledge has escaped our heads it has become less free. Knowledge deposited in a book, disseminated by a publishing company, or stored in a database has become captive to the custodian. When the platforms our oracles of knowledge stand upon are hijacked by advertisers seeking to absorb our attention for profit, the knowledge that would become wisdom in us spoils, yielding vice instead. The public square we left behind when we entered cyberspace is now empty. But the words we speak can be put back into our own mouths.

## Authenticity: messages and messengers [link](./03.md)

Messengers act on delegated authority, not their own. In order to prove the authenticity of the message they carry, they must provide a credential along with it - a forgery can lead to dire consequences. As frequency of communication has increased, we have become too trusting of the messenger. We must learn to validate the provenance of messages, and in so doing preserve our own ability to speak.

## Identity: Privacy, secrecy and anonymity [link](./04.md)

Our lives were never meant to be put on display before the world. When we broadcast our inner thoughts to whatever audience we can attract, only the most interesting - and therefore, humiliating - parts are remembered. Holding back our thoughts is an essential part of wisdom. Secrecy, on the other hand, implies that some action is purposely hidden from those who have a right to know. Anonymity may be used in service of either end - but it cannot be abolished without destroying the ability of the individual to remain a private and distinct person.

## Open Protocols: Language and open source software [link](./05.md)

The study of language is impossible to achieve with objectivity because of the fluidity of meaning. There is nothing we can do to impose our ideas of orderliness on communication; neologisms, sarcasm, malapropisms, inference, ambiguity, and omission are all part of the business of conveying meaning from one person to another. In the same way, the Free and Open Source Software movement embraces ambiguity, subjective value, and innovation in its ethic. The idea of an open protocol takes these ideas one step further by combining them into something entirely new.

# Part 3: Reforming Technology

## Things of the Earth: Simulation and transcendence [link](./06.md)

The fast pace of technological progress has seduced us into living on its own terms. The hyperreality created by being always online has expanded to subsume much of our time and attention, as we accept its Faustian offer to remake us in its own image. But whatever heights of definition the simulation brings our confected conscious, it cannot offer a true escape from the material world. Create, subjected as it is to futility, is nevertheless good, and is the only way for us to be elevated to a transcendent state of being. All that is required of us is to humble ourselves and accept its - and God's - terms.

## Chesteron's Fence: Identity and community [link](./07.md)

Although we have forgotten ourselves, we have lot lost ourselves. Base reality is always there to remind us of where we came from, and what we've been given. In the world of information we attempt to speak ourselves into existence - but that has already be done. Our role is not so much to speak as to do - to embody through ritual the speech of Another. To _do_, we must grapple with the friction inherent not only in doing, but in becoming as well. To do so, we must erect fences - not to imprison us as the walled gardens did, but to free us to exercise agency and stewardship.

## Silviculture: Maturity and time [link](./08.md)

The fences that last the longest are hedges. These take a long time to build, but not only last but provide a habitat for animals that live in them. Whereas the digital world moves at light speed, proliferating connections between people until society becomes an undifferentiated mass, maturity requires and results in patience. Skill and depth of relationship cannot exist in a culture defined by distraction. McLuhan saw media as an environment in which we are shaped by our tools; we should embrace the metaphor and practice permaculture through "digital localism".

# Part 4: Cypherspaces

## Nostr: sovereign identity, aligned storage, open protocol [link](./09.md)

Nostr brings together aspects of language, self-authentication, and localism - all revealed to us in nature - to create a new kind of digital medium. This medium honors the individual as one who may or may not choose to speak. It avoids the capture of our speech (and therefore identity) by tying speech to cryptographic identity. As an open protocol it encourages generosity, invites participation, and welcomes new ways of articulating the exchange of different kinds of information. It encourages reliance on relationships through webs of trust, self-hosting, and encryption. Nostr is as yet untried and will no doubt be revealed to have its own flaws and perverse incentives, but it follows in the footsteps of bitcoin as being a new way of arranging digital technology for human flourishing, rather than for profit.

## Understanding media: how a user-centric internet changes us [link](./10.md)

Cyphspaces are a new medium with many of the same characteristics of the digital, but with additional affordances for protecting user agency. The implications of such a medium are hard to predict, but we can anticipate some of its effects: greater accountability for actions, leading to a reticence to sign public events (or to use the medium at all); less frequent, but more severe data breaches; lower-quality software, but more aligned with users (ala linux); reduction in abuse by platforms through disintermediation and interoperability; a shift from advertising models to paid or v4v models; the spread of digital signatures to other parts of the digital world.

## Appendix: Dark Cypherspace & The Gospel

- There are negative externalities to cypherspace
  - Illegal content and criminal activity
  - Law enforcement should pursue evil, but must respect individual rights
  - Cypherspace is a technological reinforcement of liberal rights
- God trusted us with a permissionless, surveillance-free world
- Problem of evil - God gave us freedom to leave room for love
- The only solution is New Creation
- Whatever is done in the dark will be revealed
- "Nostr is decentralized, but it is a loaded gun. You're more likely to kill yourself with a gun than someone else. This is on purpose, because it wholly embraces the consequnces of being truly decentralized." (Gleason)
