# Abstract

Understanding media: how a user-centric internet changes us [link](./10.md)

Cyphspaces are a new medium with many of the same characteristics of the digital, but with additional affordances for protecting user agency. The implications of such a medium are hard to predict, but we can anticipate some of its effects: greater accountability for actions, leading to a reticence to sign public events (or to use the medium at all); less frequent, but more severe data breaches; lower-quality software, but more aligned with users (ala linux); reduction in abuse by platforms through disintermediation and interoperability; a shift from advertising models to paid or v4v models; the spread of digital signatures to other parts of the digital world.

# Outline

- New media
  - Extend, eliminate, retrieve, reverse (GTC 104, HF 73)
  - Embed the old within them, translate it to new forms (McLuhan, 8, 57, 89)
  - Promote the reverse of their embedded values as a response (McLuhan 31, 38, 45, 47, 68)
  - Create new incentives
  - Are shocking (McLuhan 64, 66), are not adopted immediately (McLuhan, 24)
- Case study
  - Literacy (McLuhan, 50, 79, 84, 85, 124, 125, 145, 172, 173)
  - Electricity (McLuhan 82)
    - Places our central nervous system outside of us (McLuhan 52)
    - McLuhan anticipates web 1.0, 2.0, and cypherspace as oscillations between speed and slowness, centralization and decentralization (McLuhan 71, 108)
- Predictions are difficult, even McLuhan's are hilarious (McLuhan 291)
- Cypherspaces
  - Shift back toward individualism (McLuhan 107)
  - Accountability for speech, loss of deniability
  - Less frequent but more severe data breaches
  - Lower-quality, more highly aligned software
  - Reduction of abuse through disintermediation and interoperability
  - Shift from advertising to paid or donation models
  - Familiarity with the tools will lead to their use elsewhere (other stuff)
  - Increase in p2p and decentralized connections (McLuhan 292)
- A new medium does not fix human nature, but it may be a salutary progression
