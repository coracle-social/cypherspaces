Abstract
--------

Self-Emulsion

Sense of acceleration, intuition that things are spiraling out of control, technology dictates more of our lives, and we're less happier than ever. People are opting out, but are captured by the medium, because the things we left behind are no longer there. Appeal to nostalgia.

Who we've become - seduced by the promise of technology for efficiency, we've optimized ourselves to death. Queering the self, quantification, instrumentalization. Erosion of community through communciation.

This is a book about fixing the internet using cryptography. But in order to even begin thinking about such a project, we have to first identify what is wrong with the internet. And that is in itself a massive undertaking because as one friend of mine put it, the internet in general (and social media in particular) is a "dog's breakfast".

On the internet, regular people are surveilled both by governments and by corporations, but criminals operate in obscurity on the "dark web". On the internet, forums for bicyclists get shut down due to regulatory pressure, while child pornographers are protected by social media platforms. On the internet, truth is brought into the service of idenitity, sowing political and cultural division. On the internet, children become addicts and adults are institutionalized by paternalistic systems of control.

That's not to say the internet doesn't have its redeeming qualities. It would be mere romanticism to suggest that technology has not vastly improved the human estate, at least in material terms. But that, as we will see, is just the point. Better medical interventions, faster travel, and frictionless communication might all be used for the good of man and nature. But in many ways, the system that gave us these good things has also deprived us of both the means and motivation to actually enter into that goodness.

# The digital tether

Even if I turn my phone off, the internet is always on. Even when I disconnect, others are connected to me. The internet has ceased to be (and arguably never was) merely an assemblage of radio transmitters, fiber-optic cables, and personal computers.

Information technology is a different kind of thing from its component parts. It is and always has been oriented primarily toward man making his mark not on the world, but on himself. The codebreakers at Bletchley Park were not directly attacking the Nazis by decoding their enigmas. Rather, through the gathering of data about the movements of German U-Boats through computation, Alan Turing was transforming the British military into an apparatus which could then go on to defeat their enemies.

As computation has coalesced into the global network that is the internet, it has made its mark on all of us, informing our thoughts, habits, and desires. The rituals of a life embedded in the digital world have, in part, displaced the rituals of the physical world, and inducted us into the values that gave rise to, and are reinforced by, the digital medium.

If we have a question, we also have an answer (even if it's canned, contrived, or re-heated by a an LLM). If we have time, we have an activity. We scroll when we stand in line, wait for the bus, sit on the toilet. We choose, instead of being present in any given moment, to abstract ourselves into the all-consuming hyper-reality of the virtual.

And if we choose to sever the connection, even for a moment, we are gripped with the "fear of missing out"; that sense that if we blink, we'll miss it. The grip that connectedness has on us is not just the comfort of a familiar habit, but is also justified by the access it gives us to news, endorsements, reviews, lifestyles, subcultures, memories, health metrics, business metrics, vanity metrics, and recipes.

Digital communcations technology is a conduit through which the entire world is compressed and uploaded into my brain, and thence into my psyche, conscience, identity, and my soul. But this conduit goes both ways. As an inhabitant of the world I cannot escape the whirlpool, but am myself compressed and uploaded back into the world-simulation. My identity is reduced to a label, my good works are done always before men, and are judged without mercy by their collective standard.

The Digital Man as an individual is liquid, fungible, interchangeable, undifferentiated, taking on form, like a photon, only when observed. Whatever we might feel is special about us and sets us apart has been externalized, commodified, and sold to the highest bidder. We live by abstraction, and die by abstraction. In the words of Guy Debord in his essay "The Society of the Spectacle",

> The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living. [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/debord/society.htm]

But maybe this is all a little overly dramatic? Is the liquefied, surveilled, censored world of the unreal the one we really live in? Do people no longer walk their dogs, take their kids out to the local coffee shop, run a booth at the farmer's market, travel to foreign countries, work wood or culitvate gardens, sit on the stoop on the first Spring day of the year and smell the lightly falling rain as it melts the last of the lingering snow? [replace with bradbury quote]

We do. But that world - the world of the physical, of friction, inconvenience, discomfort, and joy - is under attack by those who would dominate it for pleasure or for profit, and has been neglected by the rest of us. We have lost our faith in its goodness. And having lost that faith, we have lost with it the ability - or desire - to feel at home in the physical world. We are now truly "digital natives".

# Come Thou Fount

With the loss of faith has come a loss of affection. The consequence of not believing in the goodness of the physical world is that we begin to resent it, and our connection to it. Even worse, the attendant loss of faith in our own goodness as inhabitants of the created world leads to self-loathing, and from there to self-destruction.

We may attempt to lie to ourselves by disguising our trajectory using words like "progress", "futurism", "transhumanism", or "nirvana" - which comes from the Sanskrit word for "extinction" - but the fact remains that the only place to go when you want to leave reality behind is unreality.

In embracing unreality, we might create fictions and then inhabit them, or we might skew our view of the world to fit our own desires. These fictions may be interpretations about the world that validate our skepticism, or they may be alternative, constructed realities - simulations of reality as we would have it.

The story of the internet involves both types of fictions, one leading to another. This is not the place for a comprehensive history of how we got here, but I do want to highlight a few of the currents that I believe brought us to this confluence.

To begin, we must define reality, so that we can know when we've left it behind. This definition must go beyond empiricism, because "is" cannot beget "ought" - mere seeing is not sufficient belief in the goodness of the physical world we find ourselves in. There must be a basis for any system of values, or else we're left with relativism and, ultimately, nihilism.

What we are looking for is an "absolute". Such a foundation must not rely for its existence on an external frame of reference, but must itself be the origin of the entire grid. In ontological terms, it must also be a non-contingent reality.

I will not attempt here to prove the Existence of God, but I do want to point out that the God of the Bible is the only one who claims to have revealed himself to us in a way we can understand. Chaos is impersonal; Quantum Consciousness is higher dimensional and so out of reach; Allah spoke but remained aloof; but Jesus became man in order to "sympathize with our weaknesses", be "tempted as we are", and to be the "image of the invisible God". He did not merely appear, give us a list of rules, and then leave us to our own devices, but instead he became the "firstborn over all creation", and for our benefit - "when He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, And gave gifts to men."

The person of Jesus is the paradigmatic revelation of ground truth, and the source of any conception of the goodness of reality. This is axiomatic for what follows. I make no apology for this claim, faith in the goodness of creation must ultimately be founded in faith in Christ.

This is base reality: the God who created all that exists, and after whose character all truth, beauty and goodness (the "transcendent virtues") is patterned. To the extent that we shy away from reality, then, we turn our backs not on the inert physical substrate of material reality, but on the transcendent source of that reality, and all that He reveals to us about Himself.

The seeds of discontentment and rebellion against the goodness of God's created order have always been latent in the heart of man, and have presented themselves differently at different times. But for the purpose of understanding the modern problem of digitial media as a departure from reality, it's most helpful to focus on three aspects of secular humanism: measurement, freedom, and optimism about human nature.

# Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin

A basic assumption of humanism is that "man is the measure of all things", a dictum borrowed originally from the ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras. This is most famously demonstrated by Descartes' "cogito ergo sum". Wherever we _actually_ came from, knowledge begins with the human mind (or the human senses, or some combination of the two).

By starting with man, humanism seeks to liberate him from the old gods, the remoteness of Plato's "forms", and the dogmas of the Church, in order to freely explore the structure of reality itself. The only real challenge was to make the world intelligible to the human mind through observation and reason. [cite schaeffer]

Unfortunately, the physical senses of early empiricists like Robert Boyle were notoriously approximate and unreliable, and became even more so through overuse and frequent exposure to the questionable substances they worked with. Tools - scales, telescopes, refractors, barometers, micrometers - allow scientists to overcome their inherent physical limitations in order to more accurately observe the world around them.

The motivation for the production of scientific instruments is unlike that which motivates the creation of other human artifacts. Furniture is made for comfort and for beauty; the plow aided in subduing the land to the production of food; gunpowder was first discovered for its beauty and alchemical qualities, and later applied to weaponry. But the application of scientific tools is for the gathering of _data_ - in other words, their sole purpose is to measure some kind of quantity.

But it's not only mass, volume, magnetism, or light that can be measured, but human activity as well: from health to economics to diplomacy to production, if it exists there's a metric for it. Marketers live or die by their "click-through rate"; salespeople have to meet their quotas, teams of software developers have a list of "key performance indicators". Every field has its own metrics, indicators, scores, rates, and ratios to analyze the behavior and performance of its subjects.

The Renaissance humanists set out to measure the world on their own terms, only to discover that they too were subject to measurement. The scientific paradigm has been turned around on the scientist, warping his view of himself. No longer are we primarily children, craftsmen, brides and grooms, but "personal bests", "users", "customers", "constituents", quantities to be deconstructed and put to work in increasingly complex technological systems.

In Daniel chapter 5, a mysterious hand appears to the Babylonian King Belshazzar and writes four mysterious words on the wall of his palace. Daniel the prophet was able to give an explanation:

> This is the interpretation of each word. MENE: God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it; TEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting; PERES: Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

The magicians and alchemists of the Babylonian court - the scientists of that age - had been unable to make anything of the glyphs. Their own measurements and quantities had been leveled against them, and the power that it had conferred upon them stripped away. "That very night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was slain."

Like the Babylonians, who traded the wisdom of God for the illusions of magicians, modernity has traded Truth away in favor of "information". The use of tools has saturated modern life to the point that we no longer see the world through our own eyes, but filtered - either literally or figuratively - through the screen. Our ability to the shape the world is not longer determined by the skill inherent in our hands, but by the tools we direct with them - or even the people we contract with for that purpose. In an environment of extreme specialization, it becomes a test of our ingenuity to change our oil or unplug a drain, let alone to cultivate an orchard or build a house.

Our relationship with our tools goes beyond mere dependence. By allowing our instruments to intermediate our interaction with the world, our own perceptions and abilities change. "Our tools formally shape us in a way unlike and incomparable to the instrumental way we shape them." [LIG] In other words, while we may invent tools for specific purposes, the use of those same tools changes how we think, act, and experience the world.

Conversely, our shaping goes beyond our tools. To Marshall McLuhan, a pioneer in the field of media studies, tools are only one type of "medium", which McLuhan defines as [insert definition here].

We are used to thinking of media in a fairly one-dimensional way, as a simple proxy for information. But McLuhan expands the definition, saying that media can in turn encapsulate, transform, and relay other media within them [quote]. Media can create spaces, like how a street light creates a safe space on a dark street. Media can train us in new mental habits, like how print taught us how to think in a more linear fashion. Media can even provoke in us a response contrary to the attributes of the medium itself, like how sunglasses are considered a "cool" medium because by obscuring the wearer's eyes they invite others into the aura of mystery that is created. [quote]

- Framework of media (extend retrieve etc)

The ability to quantify the world has massive benefits, not least of which are the downstream effects of modern medicine, industry (the good parts), and nearly unlimited energy. But unintended consequences abound, and they have less to do with the world around us (although plenty of negative technological effects exist out there in the world), but with who we are becoming as both operators and subjects of technology.

In a world of tools optimized for processing information, everything becomes information to be processed. [poulos quote about our file] At scale, this information becomes something other than just the sum of its parts. It becomes "big data", a picture not of the individual, but of the "average" individual, an imaginary person, defined by quantities along any number of axes. Tech companies use this abstraction to feed our algorithms and serve us advertisements according to our "user persona".

As we internalize these "recommendations", we start to resemble that fictional chimera that is us, but not us. Given enough time, we'll begin acting like our manufactured user persona, presenting ourselves on social media using particular camera angles or filters, or by decing to use a particular programming language because it's one the AIs are more likely to understand.

In his book _Superbloom_, Nicholas Carr describes this collective fiction as "hyperreality", a virtual world abstracted over our collective interpretation of the real one. No longer do we do anything alone; whether we actively participate or not, our desires, preferences, and aspirations are shaped by and fed back into the machine by virtue of our dependence on the systems that subsist within this virtual world. There is no such thing as isolation or independence; even the hermit has to buy diesel for his off-grid compound's generator, is surveilled by satellites, holds a title to his property, has a mother who uses Facebook and therefore looks at him with a different set of eyes than she once did.

This should provoke a sense of fragility in the face of a mediated and unintelligible world. Not because of mere dependence, but because of our increasing alienation from the world, and therefore from ourselves.

The effect technology has on us doesn't stop at our "behavior", "habits" or "preferences", which are externalized reflections of what is actually happening inside. To the extent that anything we do, say, or believe influences the shape of our souls, the internalization of the quantified self does as well. We are not mere material, like the world that scientists study. Yet somehow those same methods of inquiry have reflected upon ourselves to change the deepest part of us.

We find ourselves in a dilemma; our tools act as a wedge keeping us from an unmediated experience of the world (and therefore the God that that world reveals), but to discard them would destroy the way we have come to know ourselves, and maybe even our place in the world. We have numbered ourselves, weighed ourselves and found ourselves wanting. The kingdom of non-technological man has been divided and given to the machines and computers.

# Libido Dominandi

If man can measure, he can understand. But humanism has a darker side, which goes beyond the use of the image of man in a descriptive way, progressing into a prescriptive ideal of man. If man can understand, he can influence.

The scientific revolution conferred immense and unprecedented power upon mankind. No longer is man subject to the natural rhythms and balances of nature; with the help of our tools we can excavate, hybridize, synthesize, clone, transport, construct skyscrapers, crops, sheep, chemicals, flowers, mines, or anything else that enters into our imagination.

As with man's knowledge of the created order this ability is not necessarily a bad thing. In Genesis 1:28, God commands Adam to "be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth." Within a framework of this "dominion mandate", Man makes his home in creation, comes to know its inhabitants, and practices husbandry in caring for them. His influence is for their good.

But man failed to keep this mandate. In his fall from the garden Adam elevated his will above that of his creator and turned the dominion mandate, against its own purpose, into "libido dominandi", the lust for power. This is the driving force behind what Augustine calls the "City of Man", a domain where the will and imagination of man is placed above, and in opposition to, the rest of creation. Man was made good, well-suited to the task of understanding and care, but he was never meant to be a despot.

In the City of Man, cultivation is replaced by production, yield by extraction, love by exploitation. It is typified by the imposition man's will upon creation as a passive substrate to be modified, extended, and abridged as suits man's purpose. This violence is a consequence of the same underlying principle that motivates the drive within humanism to measure. If man is the measure of all things for the purpose of understanding, he may also become the measure of all things according to which they may be judged. To the extent that creation resists the imposition of man's will upon it, it is in rebellion to its new master - not God the creator, but Man the usurper.

This is the basis of the second tenet of humanism: Freedom.

Now, don't get me wrong - freedom is an essential part of God's design for human society. God made man with free will. He did this not out of some perverse desire to see man fail in order to unleash his wrath on us, but for our glory and elevation. By making us, he revealed his goodness to us; by making us free he conferred on us the ability to reciprocate his love, and to enter into fellowship with him. Through this love, we are able to transcend ourselves and discover source of truth, beauty, and goodness in a way animals, plants, and rocks cannot have.

But freedom is not an end in itself. At best, it is potential energy to be spent in service of a higher cause. And the fact that we are given a choice does not mean the decision we make is not important. In order to fulfill its purpose, freedom must result not only in "a" decision, but a "right" decision. This requires a framework of ethics, and the will to apply it.

Man's original state was one of free submission to the perfectly good will of his creator. In his fallen state however, man does whatever is "right in his own eyes." Humanism demonstrates that the natural desire of man is - in place of God - to measure, divide, and find wanting. His progressive understanding of the world through self-augmentation is complemented by his increasing ability to re-shape the world into his own image. What God called "good", we see as "wild" because it is not answerable to us, but to its creator. Man's conquest of nature is an attempt to wrest creation from its maker and place it under his own rule.

This impulse does not end with the conquest of plants and animals though. Just as the observation of science is turned back upon the observer, so the domination of technology is turned back upon man himself. If knowledge confers power, knowledge of man confers power over man. The same science that gave us the ability to understand ourselves yielded technologies that can control us.

And we seem to like it! Humanistic solutions to the negative externalities of human freedom unleashed through technology cannot but involve the application of more of the same. While we have abandoned our faith in the goodness of creation, our faith in ourselves to make it better remains strong. Nicholas Carr calls this mindset the "democratization fallacy". [347] This is the idea that if we can just increase connectedness between people and give everyone a voice, we'll enter an age of "Age of Aquarius" in which empathy and justice rule. [quote, carr, barba kay]

But domination is a zero-sum game; in order for me to succeed, someone else must lose out. The corollary to the conquest of nature is the divinization of man. This is the inescapable logic of freedom in a fallen world. Because we have been alienated from God, we have no higher authority to appeal to than ourselves. Because we deny the God of creation, we tend to deny the nature that we were created with, and attempt to come up with our own version of it.

This is a major theme of James Poulos' book "Human Forever" in which he eloquently describes the mechanization of man as a consequence of our desire for freedom from God, and ultimately, the created self.

- [human forever quotes]

This culminates in the "queering of the self" [poulos].

- "Digital globalism" (HF 205)

Digital technology is our best opportunity yet to accomplish this goal of perfect self-expression. In a simulation, what we say about ourselves is true by definition, because only we have the authority to craft our digital self.

- "Techno-gnosticism" (HF 158)

- The logic of digital media is to accelerate, compress, and simplify (McLuhan)

The digital substrate is the perfect place to express ourselves, but the effect of this torrent of self-expression is the collapse of any meaning into noise. If everyone is unique, no one is. And as we seek to express our uniqueness, we adopt ever more mimetic patterns of expression, converging, ironically, on uniformity.

At the end of the day, the humanistic claim to freedom and the supremacy of the will only leaves a trail of ruined things and people, and man no closer to divinity. The technology we implemented in our quest to become masters of the universe have been turned back upon us, reducing us to records in a database, slaves of an increasingly complex system of control with no one at the helm, and from which no one can be free.

# Optimism

One final flaw of humanism is its optimism about the nature of man. If man is the measure of all things, he is the standard by which the world must be measured, but also by which it must be judged. Within a humanist framework, we must assume that man is "basically good" or suffer dire consequences. Tragically, as we have seen the fruit of humanism is not good - and man per se is no better. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." [Jeremiah 17:9] The accumulated wisdom of human tradition agrees. [more quotes from other sources about depravity: calvin? dostoevsky? nietzsche?]

Man, as man, is _not good_, and he is not good _by definition_. If God is the source and standard of all goodness, any philosophy that marginalizes him marginalizes goodness itself.

Humanism is an attempt to recover the conditions of the garden, on our own terms, and under our own power. What we have built instead is a city in which corruption, loneliness, and envy flourish. This city is ripe for destruction, "for no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ." [1 Corinthians 3:11]

This is the only hope we have for man to ever be "good" again. We must be reconciled to God, one who called man "good" in the beginning. But our own efforts to attain heaven on our own are demonstrably in vain; between us and him "there is a great gulf fixed." [Luke 16:26] In the words of Paul, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." [Romans 3:23] All except for one man, Jesus, who came to "to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross." [Colossians 1:20] Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. It is through him only that we may be reconciled to God.

[I feel like this whole chapter speaks too generally; this is abook about the internet, not human nature. I need to find a way to keep the focus on digital technology even as I talk about how we got here.]

# Technology that says no

James identifies the source of wars and fights as our desires. Humanism says yes to the will of man, which has no built-in regulating principle, because it is aimed at becoming God, an impossibility. But God self-regulates; he only created for 6 days, and said "enough". Submission to and imitation to God involves knowing where to draw the line - when to say "no".
