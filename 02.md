Censorship: Custodians of knowledge

As knowledge has escaped our heads it has become less free. Knowledge deposited in a book, disseminated by a publishing company, or stored in a database has become captive to the custodian. When the platforms our oracles of knowledge stand upon are hijacked by advertisers seeking to absorb our attention for profit, the knowledge that would become wisdom in us spoils, yielding vice instead. The public square we left behind when we entered cyberspace is now empty. But the words we speak can be put back into our own mouths.

# Outline

  - Section 230 gives carriers liability immunity when moderating content, even if constitutionally protected
